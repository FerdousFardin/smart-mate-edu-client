## About this Project

- I've used **React Router** for you to navigate seemlessly from one page to another and the pages looks nice both on PC and mobile devices.
- I've used Google's **Firebase** for authenticating so no unauthorized user can harm your website.
- I've implemented traditional email and password for login with also most common login methods like **Google** account, **GitHub** account and **Twitter** account so user don't have to go through the hassle for **Registering**.
- I've made my own Server API so I don't rely on others or free resources for API's
- I've also implemented private route for only valid and verified users so no uverified user can access the content within these private routes.
